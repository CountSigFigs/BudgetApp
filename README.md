Budget App

This is a project made with React JS. I created this app to gain experience with building components, passing down props, updating forms, and creating tables. 

To use this app, enter your budget first. Then add your expenses below. Input the name and the amount. The budget, expense, and balance icons will adjust automatically. Underneath it there is a table that will show all of your expenses. If you made a mistake, just tap the trashcan icon and the item will get deleted.
